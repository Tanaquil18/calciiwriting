  <introduction>
    <p>
      We have learned how to use the integration techniques of substitution and integration-by-parts to build
      upon basic antiderivatives and greatly increase the kinds of functions we can integrate.  For example, 
      we know that
      <me>\int \cos(x)\, dx = \sin(x)+C</me>, 
      and we also can calculate that <me>\int \sin^3(x)\cos(x)\, dx = \frac{\sin^4(x)}{4}+C</me>, 
      using substitution, since we can let <m>u=\sin(x)</m> so that <m>du=\cos(x)\, dx</m>, which transforms 
      the integral into <me>\int u^3\, du = \frac{u^4}{4}+C</me>.
    </p>
    <p>
        But what if we wanted to integrate <me>\int \sin^3(x)\cos^2(x)\, dx</me> or <me>\int \sin^2(x)\cos^2(x)\, dx</me>
        or <me>\int \sec^3(x)\tan^2(x)\, dx</me>?
    </p>
    </introduction>

      Need preview activity here.

    <example xml:id="int-with-fund-id"><title>Substitution, with an Additional Step</title>
        <p>
          Evaluate
          <me>
            \int \sin^3(x)\cos^2(x)\, dx.
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Answer:</em> We try finding a function-derivative pair, but things don't look good, since if <m>u=\sin(x)</m> then <m>du=\cos(x)\, dx</m>, 
          not <m>\cos^2(x)</m>.  Similarly, if <m>u=\cos(x)</m> then <m>du=-\sin(x)\, dx</m>, 
          not <m>-\sin^3(x)</m>.  Trying combinations of <m>\sin(x)</m> and <m>\cos(x)</m> gets messy quickly, 
          since we'd need to use product rule to calculate the derivative, and the integrand is not a sum of terms.  
        </p>
        <p>
          However, we do know something about how <m>\sin(x)</m> and <m>\cos(x)</m> are related to each other.  
          Specifically, the Fundamental Trigonometric Identity says that 
          <men xml:id="eqn-fund-trig">
            \sin^2(x)+\cos^2(x)=1.
          </men>
          
          What if we tried a substitution, and then if we still had either <m>\sin^2(x)</m> or <m>\cos^2(x)</m>
          in our integral, we used the Fundamental Trigonometric Identity to rewrite it?
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's try <m>u=\cos(x)</m>, so that <m>du=-\sin(x)\, dx</m>.  Then
          <md>
            <mrow> \int \sin^3(x)\cos^2(x)\, dx \amp = \int \sin^2(x)\sin(x)\cos^2(x)\, dx </mrow>
            <mrow>  \amp = \int \sin^2(x)\cos^2(x)\big(\sin(x)\, dx\big) </mrow>
            <mrow>  \amp = \int \big(1-\cos^2(x)\big)\cdot\cos^2(x)\cdot\big(\sin(x)\, dx\big) </mrow>
            <mrow>  \amp = \int \big(1-u^2\big)\cdot u^2\cdot(-du) </mrow>
            <mrow>  \amp = \int (u^4-u^2)\, du </mrow>
            <mrow>  \amp = \frac{u^5}{5}-\frac{u^3}{3}+C </mrow>
            <mrow>  \amp = \frac{\cos^5(x)}{5}-\frac{\cos^3(x)}{3}+C </mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
            It worked! And it was mostly using our familiar technique of substitution, once we recognized when
            we needed to use a trigonometric identity to rewrite something we had remaining in our integral.  
        </p>
    </example>
    <p>
      This same strategy can be used whenever powers of sine and cosine (with the same argument) are multiplied together and one of the 
      exponents is an odd, positive integer: one power can be factored out to be the <m>du</m>, an odd minus 1 is now even,
      and so the remaining powers can be turned into an expression of <m>u</m> using the Fundamental Trigonometric Identity.
    </p>

    <!-- <example>
      For an integral of the form $\int \sin^m z \cos^n z \ dz$ }
\begin{enumerate} 
\item If the exponent of $\sin z$ or $\cos z$ is an odd positive integer:
\begin{itemize}
\item Without loss of generality, the exponent of $\cos z$ is odd.  
\item Factor out a copy of $\cos z$, and the remaining power of $\cos z$ is even.
\item Use the identity $\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta =1$, so $\cos^2 z = 1 - \sin^2 z$.
\item Then let $u=\sin z$, so $du=\cos z \ dz$ cancels with the copy you factored out, and the remaining factors can all be put in terms of $u$.
\end{itemize}
\item If both exponents of $\sin z$ and $\cos z$ are even nonnegative integers:
\begin{itemize}
\item We use our half-angle identities, possibly repeatedly:
\item \hskip .2in$\sin^2 z=\frac{1-\cos (2z)}{2}$
\hskip .3in $\cos^2 z=\frac{1+\cos (2z)}{2}$
\end{itemize}

    <title>More substitution with trig identities</title>
    <p>
      The main principle behind <xref ref="assemblage-sin-cos-one-odd" text="title"/> is that we are using substitution
      to integrate, and the Fundamental Trigonometric Identity to rewrite what remains in terms of the function
      in the function-derivative pair.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also encounter other pairings besides sine and cosine of a trigonometric function and its derivative (up to a constant); however,
      the other derivatives are products or powers, so the method is a little more complicated.  Let's recall that
      the derivative of <m>\tan(x)</m> is <m>\sec^2(x)</m>.  Let's also recall that if we divide both sides of the Fundamental
      Trigonometric Identity <xref ref="eqn-fund-trig"/> by <m>\cos^2(x)</m>, we get
      <me>
        \frac{\sin^2(x)}{\cos^2(x)}+\frac{\cos^2(x)}{\cos^2(x)}=\frac{1}{\cos^2(x)},
      </me>
      and rewriting that to be in terms of <m>\tan(x)=\frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)}</m> and <m>\sec(x)=\frac{1}{\cos(x)}</m>
      means we get
      <men xml:id="eqn-fund-trig-sec-tan">
            \tan^2(x)+1=\sec^2(x)
      </men>
      
      This means that if we're trying to use substitution in an integral with a product of powers of secant and tangent,
      we need the exponent of <m>\sec(x)</m> to be <em>even</em>, so that one copy of <m>\sec^2(x)</m> can be the derivative of <m>\tan(x)</m>,
      and the remaining (even) powers of <m>\sec(x)</m> can be rewritten using <xref ref="eqn-fund-trig-sec-tan"/>.  We can also have an odd
      exponent of <m>\tan(x)</m>, so that one copy will be part of the derivative of <m>\sec{x}</m>, and the remaining even exponent of <m>\tan(x)</m> can be 
      rewritten into an expression of <m>\sec(x)</m> using <xref ref="eqn-fund-trig-sec-tan"/>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Do two examples, one of each sec-tan type, then an assemblage of the method, then the csc-cot discussion
       and assemblage. Another example? Where do the activities go?  
    </p>

    <p>
      Similarly, dividing both sides of the Fundamental
      Trigonometric Identity <xref ref="eqn-fund-trig"/> by <m>\sin^2(x)</m> results in
      <me>
        \frac{\sin^2(x)}{\sin^2(x)}+\frac{\cos^2(x)}{\sin^2(x)}=\frac{1}{\sin^2(x)},
      </me>
      and rewriting that to be in terms of <m>\cot(x)=\frac{\cos(x)}{\sin(x)}</m> and <m>\csc(x)=\frac{1}{\sin(x)}</m>
      means we get
      <men xml:id="eqn-fund-trig-csc-cot">
            1+\cot^2(x)=\csc^2(x)
      </men>
