  <introduction>
    <p>
      We have learned how to use the integration techniques of substitution and integration-by-parts to build
      upon basic antiderivatives and greatly increase the kinds of functions we can integrate.  For example, 
      we know that
      <me>\int \cos(x)\, dx = \sin(x)+C</me>, 
      and we also can calculate that <me>\int \sin^3(x)\cos(x)\, dx = \frac{\sin^4(x)}{4}+C</me>, 
      using substitution, since we can let <m>u=\sin(x)</m> so that <m>du=\cos(x)\, dx</m>, which transforms 
      the integral into <me>\int u^3\, du = \frac{u^4}{4}+C</me>.
    </p>
    <p>
        But what if we wanted to integrate <me>\int \sin^3(x)\cos^2(x)\, dx</me> or <me>\int \sin^2(x)\cos^2(x)\, dx</me>
        or <me>\int \sec^3(x)\tan^2(x)\, dx</me>?
    </p>
    </introduction>

    <subsection><title>Integrals Involving Sine and Cosine</title>

    <example xml:id="int-with-fund-id"><title>Substitution, with an Additional Step</title>
        <p>
          Evaluate
          <me>
            \int \sin^3(x)\cos^2(x)\, dx.
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Answer:</em> We try finding a function-derivative pair, but things don't look good, since if <m>u=\sin(x)</m> then <m>du=\cos(x)\, dx</m>, 
          not <m>\cos^2(x)</m>.  Similarly, if <m>u=\cos(x)</m> then <m>du=-\sin(x)\, dx</m>, 
          not <m>-\sin^3(x)</m>.  Trying combinations of <m>\sin(x)</m> and <m>\cos(x)</m> gets messy quickly, 
          since we'd need to use product rule to calculate the derivative, and the integrand is not a sum of terms.  
        </p>
        <p>
          However, we do know something about how <m>\sin(x)</m> and <m>\cos(x)</m> are related to each other.  
          Specifically, the Fundamental Trigonometric Identity says that 
          <men xml:id="eqn-fund-trig">
            \sin^2(x)+\cos^2(x)=1.
          </men>
          
          What if we tried a substitution, and then if we still had either <m>\sin^2(x)</m> or <m>\cos^2(x)</m>
          in our integral, we used the Fundamental Trigonometric Identity to rewrite it?
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's try <m>u=\cos(x)</m>, so that <m>du=-\sin(x)\, dx</m>.  Then
          <md>
            <mrow> \int \sin^3(x)\cos^2(x)\, dx \amp = \int \sin^2(x)\sin(x)\cos^2(x)\, dx </mrow>
            <mrow>  \amp = \int \sin^2(x)\cos^2(x)\big(\sin(x)\, dx\big) </mrow>
            <mrow>  \amp = \int \big(1-\cos^2(x)\big)\cdot\cos^2(x)\cdot\big(\sin(x)\, dx\big) </mrow>
            <mrow>  \amp = \int \big(1-u^2\big)\cdot u^2\cdot(-du) </mrow>
            <mrow>  \amp = \int (u^4-u^2)\, du </mrow>
            <mrow>  \amp = \frac{u^5}{5}-\frac{u^3}{3}+C </mrow>
            <mrow>  \amp = \frac{\cos^5(x)}{5}-\frac{\cos^3(x)}{3}+C </mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
            It worked! And it was mostly using our familiar technique of substitution, once we recognized when
            we needed to use a trigonometric identity to rewrite something we had remaining in our integral.  
        </p>
    </example>
    <p>
      This same strategy can be used whenever powers of sine and cosine (with the same argument) are multiplied together and one of the 
      exponents is an odd, positive integer: one power can be factored out to be the <m>du</m>, an odd minus 1 is now even,
      and so the remaining powers can be turned into an expression of <m>u</m> using the Fundamental Trigonometric Identity.
    </p>

        Suppose you have an integral of the form <me>\int \sin^m(z)\cos^n(z)\, dz
        </me>
        where either <m>m</m> or <m>n</m> (or both) is an odd, positive integer. Without loss of generality,
        let's say <m>n</m>, the exponent of cosine, is odd and positive.  
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Factor out one copy of the trig function with the odd power (in this case <m>\cos(z)</m>) to serve as the <m>du</m>.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Rewrite the remaining powers of <m>\cos(z)</m> (which originally had an odd exponent and will now have an even exponent)
              in terms of <m>\sin(z)</m> using the Fundamental Trigonometric Identity <m>\cos^2(z)=1-\sin^2(z)</m>.
            </p>

          <li>
            <p>
              Set <m>u</m> equal to <m>\sin(z)</m> (because <m>\cos(z)</m> originally had an odd exponent.)

    <p>
      What if we have an integral involving a product of sines and cosines but neither of the functions has 
      and odd, positive integer exponent?  We have another method that can be used in the case that both sine and
      cosine have even, nonnegative integer exponents.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="int-with-half-angle"><title>Sine and Cosine with Even Exponents</title>
        <p>
          Evaluate
          <me>
            \int \sin^2(x)\, dx.
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Answer:</em> If we rewrote <m>\sin^2(x)</m> 
          in terms of <m>\cos^2(x)</m> using the Fundamental Trigonometric identity, then we wouldn't 
          have any copy of <m>\sin(x)</m> leftover to serve as the <m>du</m> if we made a <m>u-</m>substitution.   
        </p>
        <p>
          However, there are two more trigonometric identities we can make use of, called the
           <em>Half-angle identities</em>
          <mdn>
            <mrow> \sin^2(x) \amp = \frac{1-\cos(2x)}{2} </mrow>
            <mrow> \cos^2(x) \amp = \frac{1+\cos(2x)}{2} </mrow>
          </mdn>
        </p>
        <p>
            Then
          <md>
            <mrow> \int \sin^2(x)\, dx \amp = \int \frac{1-\cos(2x)}{2}\, dx </mrow>
            <mrow>  \amp = \frac{1}{2}\int \big(1-\cos(2x)\big)\, dx </mrow>
            <mrow>  \amp = \frac{1}{2}\big[x-\frac{\sin(2x)}{2}\big]+C </mrow>
            <mrow>  \amp = \frac{x}{2}-\frac{\sin(2x)}{4}+C </mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Half-angle identity helped because it brought the exponent down by 1, and we 
            know how to calculate antiderivatives for both <m>1</m> and <m>\cos(2x)</m>.

    <title>More substitution with trig identities</title>
    <p>
      The main principle behind <xref ref="assemblage-sin-cos-one-odd" text="title"/> is that we are using substitution
      to integrate, and the Fundamental Trigonometric Identity to rewrite what remains in terms of the function
      in the function-derivative pair.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also encounter other pairings besides sine and cosine of a trigonometric function and its derivative (up to a constant).  Let's recall that if we divide both sides of the Fundamental
      Trigonometric Identity <xref ref="eqn-fund-trig"/> by <m>\cos^2(x)</m>, we get
      <me>
        \frac{\sin^2(x)}{\cos^2(x)}+\frac{\cos^2(x)}{\cos^2(x)}=\frac{1}{\cos^2(x)},
      </me>
      and rewriting that to be in terms of <m>\tan(x)=\frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)}</m> and <m>\sec(x)=\frac{1}{\cos(x)}</m>
      means we get
      <men xml:id="eqn-fund-trig-sec-tan">
            \tan^2(x)+1=\sec^2(x)
      </men>
      
      We also recall that the derivative of <m>\tan(x)</m> is <m>\sec^2(x)</m>, and that the derivative
      of <m>\sec(x)</m> is <m>\sec(x)\tan(x)</m>. If we have an integral with a product of powers of secant and tangent, as long as
      the exponents of one or the other satisfy certain conditions, we can do the same thing that we did with sine and cosine:
      make a <m>u-</m>substitution and use the (modified) Fundamental Trigonometric Identity to rewrite the
      other trig function in terms of the one we called <m>u</m>.

      but the following activity is a rather beautiful example of mathematicians figuring out how to use the hammer of 
      our ability to integrate trigonometric functions, even when the integral starts out not looking like it involves 
      trigonometry at all.  
    </p>

    <activity>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The method demonstrated in this activity is most useful when the integral cannot be calculated in another way, but we 
      will consider an example which can also be done with <m>u-</m> substitution so that we can verify that we obtain the same answer.
        </p>
        <p>
          <ol marker="a. ">
<li> <p>State the reason why <m>u</m>-substitution cannot be used on the integral <me>\int \frac{1}{(x^2+4)^2} \, dx</me>. </p></li>

<li> <p>For the remainder of this activity, we consider 
<me>\int \frac{x}{(x^2+4)^2} \, dx</me>. First, calculate the integral using <m>u</m>-substitution, with <m>u = x^2+4</m>.</p> </li>

<li> <p>We recognize the term <m>x^2+4</m> is of the form <m>x^2+a^2</m>, which reminds us of the hypotenuse of a right triangle, whose legs are <m>x</m> and <m>2</m>. 
(We previously did something similar in Calculus I <url href="
https://activecalculus.org/single-alt/sec-2-6-inverse.html#sec-2-6-inverse-6-9-1">here</url>
). </p>

<shortdescription>A right triangle with legs whose lengths are x and a. </shortdescription>
</image>
<p>
  Use the triangle to calculate <m>\tan \theta</m> and <m>\sec \theta</m> in terms of <m>x</m>.
</p>
</li>

<li> <p>Use your expression for <m>\tan \theta</m> to solve for <m>x</m>, then differentiate to calculate <m>dx</m>. </p></li>

<li> <p>Use your expression for <m>\sec \theta</m> to solve for <m>x^2+4</m>. </p> </li>

<li> <p> Substitute what you've found into <me>\int \frac{x}{(x^2+4)^2} \, dx</me>, replacing <m>x</m>, <m>dx</m>, and <m>x^2+4</m> with expressions involving <m>\theta</m>. </p></li>

<li> <p>Calculate the trigonometric integral, using the method for when the exponent of <m>\tan</m> is odd. </p></li>

<li> <p>Finally, put the answer back in terms of <m>x</m>, using the triangle shown above, and/or the expressions you already calculated. </p></li>
