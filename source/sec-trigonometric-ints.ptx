  <introduction>
    <p>
      We have learned how to use the integration techniques of substitution and integration-by-parts to build
      upon basic antiderivatives and greatly increase the kinds of functions we can integrate.  For example, we know that
      <me>\int \cos(x)\, dx = \sin(x)+C</me> and using substitution, we know that <me>\int \sin^3(x)\cos(x)\, dx = \frac{\sin^4(x)}{4}+C</me>, since we can let
      <m>u=\sin(x)</m> so that <m>du=\cos(x)\, dx</m>, which transforms the integral into <m>\int u^3\, du = \frac{u^4}{4}+C</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
        But what if we wanted to integrate <me>\int \sin^3(x)\cos^2(x)\, dx</me>?
    </p>

    <example xml:id="int-with-fund-id"><title>Substitution, with an Additional Step</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Evaluate
          <me>
            \int \sin^3(x)\cos^2(x)\, dx.
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We try finding a function-derivative pair, but things don't look good, since if <m>u=\sin(x)</m> then <m>du=\cos(x)\, dx</m>, 
          not <m>\cos^2(x)</m>.  Similarly, if <m>u=\cos(x)</m> then <m>du=-\sin(x)\, dx</m>, 
          not <m>-\sin^3(x)</m>.  Trying combinations of <m>\sin(x)</m> and <m>\cos(x)</m> gets messy quickly, 
          since we'd need to use product rule to calculate the derivative, and the integrand is not a sum of terms.  
        </p>
        <p>
          However, we do know something about how <m>\sin(x)</m> and <m>\cos(x)</m> are related to each other.  
          Specifically, the Fundamental Trigonometric Identity says that 
          <me>
            \sin^2(x)+\cos^2(x)=1.
          </me>
          What if we tried a substitution, and then if we still had either <m>\sin^2(x)</m> or <m>\cos^2(x)</m>
          in our integral, we used the Fundamental Trigonometric Identity to rewrite it?
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's try <m>u=\cos(x)</m>, so that <m>du=-\sin(x)\, dx</m>.  Then
          <md>
            <mrow> \int \sin^3(x)\cos^2(x)\, dx \amp = \int \sin^2(x)\sin(x)\cos^2(x)\, dx </mrow>
            <mrow>  \amp = \int \sin^2(x)\cos^2(x)\big(\sin(x)\, dx\big) </mrow>
            <mrow>  \amp = \int \sin^2(x)u^2\big(-du\big) </mrow>
            <mrow>  \amp = \int -\big(1-\cos^2(x)\big)u^2\, du </mrow>
            <mrow>  \amp = \int -\big(1-u^2\big)u^2\, du </mrow>
            <mrow>  \amp = \int (u^4-u^2)\, du </mrow>
            <mrow>  \amp = \frac{u^5}{5}-\frac{u^3}{3}+C </mrow>
            <mrow>  \amp = \frac{\cos^5(x)}{5}-\frac{\cos^3(x)}{3}+C </mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
            It worked! And it was mostly using our familiar technique of substitution, once we recognized when
            we needed to use a trigonometric identity to rewrite something we had remaining in our integral.
