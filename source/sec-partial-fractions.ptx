  <introduction>
    <p>
      The need to integrate rational functions arises in differential equations and in other settings,
      and so we wonder about how to integrate them.  If we are lucky, we can use substitution or integration by parts, 
      but sometimes neither of those methods can be used.  
    </p>

        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We see a function-derivative pair (up to a constant), since if <m>u=x^2+1</m> then <m>du=2x\, dx</m>.
          So we rewrite 
          <md>
            <mrow> \int \frac{5x}{x^2+1} \, dx \amp = \frac{5}{2}\int \frac{1}{u}\, du </mrow>

      <title>Starting the Method of Partial Fractions</title>

    <p>
      In <xref ref="int-with-sub-ex"/>, the derivative of the function in the denominator was sitting in the numerator 
      (up to a constant multiple).  What if we needed to integrate this instead?
      <me>
        \int \frac{5x}{x^2-x-2} \, dx
      </me>?
    </p>
    <p>
      We could try what we did before and pick <m>u=x^2-x-2</m>, but then we calculate that <m>du=(2x-1)\, dx</m>, which does not help
      us in the numerator.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead, we try a completely different strategy.  If we somehow knew that 
      <me>
        \frac{5x}{x^2-x-2} = \frac{10/3}{x-2} + \frac{5/3}{x+1}
      </me>, 
      then we could integrate both sides of the equation to get 
      <me>
        \int \frac{5x}{x^2-x-2} \, dx = \int \frac{10/3}{x-2} + \frac{5/3}{x+1} \, dx
      </me>, and the integral on the right is straightforward, giving us
      <me>
        \int \frac{5x}{x^2-x-2} \, dx = \frac{10}{3} \ln|x-2| + \frac{5}{3}\ln|x+1| + C
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can verify that 
      <me>
        \frac{5x}{x^2-x-2} = \frac{10/3}{x-2} + \frac{5/3}{x+1}
      </me>
      is indeed true by recombining the right-hand-side of the equation using a common denominator.  
      <md>
        <mrow> \frac{10/3}{x-2} + \frac{5/3}{x+1} \amp = \frac{10/3(x+1)}{(x-2)(x+1)} + \frac{5/3(x-2)}{(x+1)(x-2)}</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp =\frac{\frac{10}{3}x+\frac{10}{3}+\frac{5}{3}x-\frac{10}{3} }{(x-2)(x+1)}</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp =\frac{ \frac{15}{3}x}{(x-2)(x+1)}</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp =\frac{5x}{x^2-x-2}</mrow>
         
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      The question is: how did we come up with
      <me>
        \frac{5x}{x^2-x-2} = \frac{10/3}{x-2} + \frac{5/3}{x+1}
      </me>
      in the first place?
    </p>

    <p>
        One clue is that the denominator of the rational function in the integral factors into two linear terms,
        <me>
          x^2-x-2 = (x-2)(x+1)
        </me>,
        and those are exactly the denominators of the simpler rational functions we used.   
    </p>

    <p>
      We suppose that
          <me>
            \frac{5x}{(x-2)(x+1)} = \frac{A}{x-2} + \frac{B}{x+1}
          </me>
      and then we can look for the constants <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
          Multiplying both sides of this equation by <m>(x-2)(x+1)</m>,
          we find that
          <me>
            \frac{5x\cancel{(x-2)(x+1)}}{\cancel{(x-2)(x+1)}}= \frac{A(x+1)\cancel{(x-2)}}{\cancel{x-2}} + \frac{B\cancel{(x+1)}(x-2)}{\cancel{x+1}}
          </me>
          which means
          <me>
            5x = A(x+1) + B(x-2)
          </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
          Because this equation should hold for <em>every value</em> of <m>x</m>,
          we can use inspired choices of <em>specific</em> <m>x</m>-values to help us find <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.
          Taking <m>x = -1</m>, we have
          <me>
            5(-1) = A(0) + B(-3)
          </me>,
          so <m>B = \frac{5}{3}</m>.
          Choosing <m>x = 2</m>, it follows
          <me>
            5(2) = A(3) + B(0)
          </me>,
          so <m>A = \frac{10}{3}</m>.
          Thus,
          <me>
            \int \frac{5x}{x^2-x-2} \, dx = \int \frac{10/3}{x-2} + \frac{5/3}{x+1} \, dx
          </me>.
    </p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection xml:id="subsec-when-method-used">
    <title>When Can The Methods In This Example Be Used?</title>
    <p>
      Notice that any terms of the form <m>\frac{A}{ax+b}</m>, a number in the numerator divided by a linear term
      in the denominator, would be similarly easy to integrate, using <m>u=ax+b</m> so that <m>du=a\, dx</m>. Then
      <me>
        \int \frac{A}{ax+b} \, dx = \frac{A}{a}\ln|ax+b|+C
      </me>
      The main question to explore in the next activity is: When can we integrate a rational function by rewriting into terms like this?

    <title>A Quadratic Term and a Linear Term</title>
    <p>
      As we saw in the activity, we have to be careful with the form of our partial fraction decomposition
      if factoring the denominator results in anything other than distinct linear terms.  
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, when we had a numerator of <m>x^2+x+4</m>, there are <m>3</m> numbers: the coefficient
      of the <m>x^2</m> term, the coefficient of the <m>x</m> term, and the constant term.  Using
      <m>\frac{A}{x-1}+\frac{B}{x^2+1}</m> gave us <m>2</m> numbers to solve for, <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>,
      and in this case, it was impossible to find values of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> to make the equality hold.  But we can
      modify the partial fraction form to introduce a third number.

            </me>
          and note that this gives us <m>3</m> constants to work with.<fn>We avoid using <m>C</m> as a coefficient because we
          don't want to get it confused with the <m>+C</m> at the end of an indefinite integral.</fn>  Before we look for the values
           of the constants <m>A</m>, <m>B</m> and <m>D</m>, we will integrate to make sure this is a better
           form than the one we started with.  
        </p>
        <p>
          An antiderivative of <m>\frac{A}{x-1}</m> is <m>A\ln|x-1|</m>. We can calculate
          <me>
            \int \frac{Bx+D}{x^2+1} \, dx = \int \frac{Bx}{x^2+1} \, dx + \int \frac{D}{x^2+1} \, dx
          </me>
          and note that the second integral is one of our basic forms, <m>D\arctan(x)</m>, while the first
          can be evaluated with substitution taking <m>u=x^2+1</m> so that <m>du=2x\, dx</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus we see that if we can find such numbers <m>A</m>, <m>B</m> and <m>D</m>, then we can integrate
          <md>
            <mrow> \int \frac{x^2+x+4}{(x^2+1)(x-1)} \, dx \amp = \int \left(\frac{A}{x-1} + \frac{Bx+D}{x^2+1}\right) dx</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = \int \frac{A}{x-1} dx + \int \frac{Bx}{x^2+1}dx + \int \frac{D}{x^2+1}dx</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = A\ln|x-1|+\frac{B}{2}\ln|x^2+1|+D\arctan(x) +C </mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that we've done the calculus part, we turn our attention to the algebra.  
          Multiplying both sides of the integrand by <m>(x-1)(x^2+1)</m>,
          we find that
          <me>
            \frac{(x^2+x+4)\cancel{(x-1)(x^2+1)}}{\cancel{(x-1)(x^2+1)}}= \frac{A(x^2+1)\cancel{(x-1)}}{\cancel{x-1}} + \frac{(Bx+D)\cancel{(x^2+1)}(x-1)}{\cancel{x^2+1}}
          </me>
          which means
          <me>
            x^2+x+4 = A(x^2+1) + (Bx+D)(x-1)
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have several tools in our toolbox for solving for the unknown numbers.
          We could... 
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                ... use the black box method.  Use a solver like Wolfram Alpha or another computational tool.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                ... set <m>x</m> equal to different values like we've done before.  
                This is slightly more complicated than when the denominator factored into linear terms, 
                but we can still do it, taking <m>x=1</m>, then <m>x=0</m>, then <m>x=-1</m>, or any three
                values of <m>x</m> you choose and find easiest to work with.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                ... compare coefficients of both sides of the equation and get a system of equations to solve.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the first two methods don't give us anything new to discuss, we choose to 
          demonstrate the last method here.  Recall that we are trying to solve
          <me>
            x^2+x+4 = A(x^2+1) + (Bx+D)(x-1)
          </me>
          for the unknown values of <m>A</m>, <m>B</m> and <m>D</m> so that the two sides are equal
          for all possible values of <m>x</m>.  This means the two sides must really be the same function
          of <m>x</m>, or the same polynomial of <m>x</m>.  Multiplying out the right-hand side and grouping
          like terms together gives
          <md>
            <mrow> x^2+x+4 \amp = A(x^2+1) + (Bx+D)(x-1) </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = Ax^2+A + Bx^2-Bx+Dx-D</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = (A+B)x^2+(-B+D)x+(A-D)</mrow>
          </md>
          Setting like coefficients equal means that <m>A+B=1</m> (because those are the corresponding
          coefficients of the <m>x^2</m> term) and <m>-B+D=1</m> (because those are the corresponding
          coefficients of the <m>x</m> term) and <m>A-D=4</m> (because those are the constant terms).
        </p>
        <p>
          This gives us a system of linear equations, three equations and three unknowns.  Combining this
          with the second method, of setting <m>x=1</m> to find that <m>1^2+1+4=A(1^2+1)+(Bx+D)(1-1)</m> and so
          <m>A=3</m> would reduce this to two unknowns and often be the fastest to solve by hand. (Since <m>A=3</m>
          and <m>A+B=1</m>, this means that <m>B=-2</m>; similarly, since <m>A-D=4</m>, this means that <m>D=-1</m>.)
          Since we already integrated to find that
          <me>\int \frac{x^2+x+4}{(x^2+1)(x-1)} \, dx = A\ln|x-1|+\frac{B}{2}\ln|x^2+1|+D\arctan(x) +C</me>
          we can substitute the values we've found and calculate that
          <me>\int \frac{x^2+x+4}{(x^2+1)(x-1)} \, dx = 3\ln|x-1|+\frac{-2}{2}\ln|x^2+1|-1\arctan(x) +C</me>
          which answers the question we were attempting to solve.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, it's worth noting that if we've had a little bit of matrix theory or linear algebra, we can use matrices to solve a system of linear equations, and that would give us
          <md>
            <mrow>\amp A \amp \amp+ B \amp \amp \ \amp \amp=1 </mrow>
            <mrow>\amp  \amp \amp- B \amp \amp+ D \amp \amp=1 </mrow>
            <mrow>\amp A \amp \amp \amp \amp-D \amp \amp=4 </mrow>
          </md>
          which becomes <m>\begin{bmatrix} 1 \amp 1 \amp 0 \amp 1 \\ 0 \amp -1 \amp 1 \amp 1 \\1 \amp 0 \amp -1 \amp 4 \end{bmatrix}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Solving this using Gaussian elimination results in <m>\begin{bmatrix} 1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 3 \\ 0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \amp -2 \\0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp -1 \end{bmatrix}</m>,
          which does give us the same values of <m>A=3</m>, <m>B=-2</m>, and <m>D=-1</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, this matrix form tells us something more:
          that this system of equations will have a unique solution <alert>regardless of the starting coefficients of the quadratic in the numerator of the integrand.</alert>
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that we don't have to use matrices at all - we have other tools for solving a system of equations. However, this example generalizes and bears repeating: 
           <alert>as long as the numerator of the integrand is less than or equal to degree <m>2</m>, and the denominator factors into a linear and an irreducible quadratic,
          we can find a partial fraction decomposition and calculate the integral by setting it up in this way, with a constant over the linear factor
          and a linear term over the quadratic factor.</alert><fn>See later for what to do if the degree is greater than or equal to <m>3</m> with this same factored form of the denominator.</fn>
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, we can see the problem that occurred when we had the wrong form of the partial fraction
          decomposition.  When we attempted to set <m>\frac{x^2+x+4}{(x^2+1)(x-1)} = \frac{A}{x-1}+\frac{B}{x^2+1}</m> and
          cleared the denominators, we got <me>x^2+x+4 = A(x^2+1)+B(x-1) = Ax^2+Bx+A-B.</me>
          Setting corresponding coefficients equal gives us
          <md>
            <mrow>\amp A \amp \amp \amp \amp=1 </mrow>
            <mrow>\amp  \amp \amp B \amp  \amp=1 </mrow>
            <mrow>\amp A \amp \amp-B \amp \amp=4 </mrow>
          </md>
          which becomes <m>\begin{bmatrix} 1 \amp 0  \amp 1 \\ 0 \amp 1  \amp 1 \\1 \amp -1  \amp 4 \end{bmatrix}</m>,
          which row reduces to <m>\begin{bmatrix} 1 \amp 0  \amp 1 \\ 0 \amp 1  \amp 1 \\0 \amp 0  \amp 1 \end{bmatrix}</m>, 
          an inconsistent system (no possible solutions for <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.)  
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the important takeaways from this is that the form of the partial fraction decomposition matters.

        <li>
          <p>
            When the factored form of the denominator contains a linear term, the partial fraction decomposition

      up to the max power.

        <li>
          <p>
            When the factored form of the denominator contains a quadratic term, the partial fraction
      decomposition contains a linear term divided by the quadratic term.

    <title>Final Considerations</title>
    
    <p>
      An especially astute reader might notice that we said that the denominator can contain terms of the form
      <m>ax^2+bx+c</m> but we only considered terms of the form <m>x^2+k</m> in our examples and activities.
      The reason is that every <m>ax^2+bx+c</m> can be written as <m>a\left( \left(x-\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2+k\right)</m>
      if we recall how to <em>complete the square</em> from algebra class, and then using a substitution <fn><m>y=x-\frac{b}{2a}</m>
      so that <m>dy=dx</m></fn> turns this into some constant number multiplied by <m>y^2+k</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this turns a calculus problem into even more of an algebra problem, and the focus of this material 
      is integration, not algebra.
    </p>
    <p>
      You might also be wondering what happens if the denominator doesn't factor into powers of linear and quadratic terms.
      It is a theorem beyond the scope of this class, called the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, that every polynomial over the real numbers factors into
      powers of linear and quadratic terms. 
      <!-- Is it really the FTA or is there another theorem for the real case? -->
    </p>

    <p>
      The result is that every rational function, regardless of the degree of the numerator or denominator,
      or how the denominator factors, can be integrated using some combination of the techniques
      described in this section.  Putting that theory into practice, however, is very often no trivial matter!

    <title>Summary</title>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Given any rational function with the degree of the numerator strictly less than the degree 
            of the denominator, we can rewrite the function as a sum of terms of the form
              <me>
                \frac{A}{(ax+b)^n}\ \text{or }\frac{Ax+B}{\left(ax^2 + bx +c \right)^n}
              </me>
            where <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>,
            and <m>c</m> are real numbers,
            and <m>n</m> is a natural number.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Which of the forms are included in the decomposition of a rational function depends entirely on the factored form of the denominator,
            and each of those forms can be integrated using basic integrals, substitution, and/or trigonometric substitution, possibly requiring some algebra.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Similar to how every improper fraction can be expressed as an integer plus a proper fraction, every rational function with the degree of the numerator greater than or equal to the degree 
            of the denominator can be expressed as <m>p(x)+\frac{q(x)}{r(x)}</m> where <m>p(x)</m> is a polynomial
            and the degree of <m>q(x)</m> is strictly less than the degree of <m>r(x)</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            This means that every rational function has an antiderivative function we can express without an integral.
