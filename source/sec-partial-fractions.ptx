      The need to integrate rational functions arises in differential equations and in other settings.  If we are lucky, we can use substitution or integration by parts, 
      but oftentimes neither of those methods can be used.  In this section, we learn how to use algebra together
      with our past integration techniques to integrate rational functions.

      <title>The Building Blocks of the Method</title>
      <p>
        We are interested in integrating functions which are polynomials divided by polynomials.  
        There are some functions of this form we already know how to do using previous methods. 
        Each of these integrals comes up frequently enough that we collect them here for reference.

        In all of the following formulas, let <m>A, b</m> and <m>n</m> be numbers, with <m>n \neq 1</m>.

          The method of partial fractions we learn in this section could be summarized as the following: reduce all functions of the form

    <subsection xml:id="subsec-start-method-part-frac">
      <title>Starting the Method of Partial Fractions</title>
          <p>
            We already had the tools to calculate an integral like
          <me>
            \int \frac{5x}{x^2+1} \, dx = \frac{5}{2}\ln|x^2+1|+C
          </me>
       because there is a function-derivative pair in the integrand. If we let <m>u=x^2+1</m> then <m>du=2x\, dx</m>,
          and <m>5x</m> is a constant multiple of <m>2x</m>, so we get
          <md>
            <mrow> \int \frac{5x}{x^2+1} \, dx \amp = \frac{5}{2}\int \frac{1}{u}\, du </mrow>
            <mrow>  \amp = \frac{5}{2}\ln|u|+C </mrow>
            <mrow>  \amp = \frac{5}{2}\ln|x^2+1|+C </mrow>
          </md>.
          
        </p>

    <p>
     However, what if there isn't a function-derivative pair in the integrand? Consider
      <me>
        \int \frac{5x}{x^2-x-2} \, dx
      </me>.
      Substitution does not help with integrating this function, since if we let <m>u=x^2-x-2</m> then <m>du=(2x-1)\, dx</m>, 
      which is not a constant multiple of <m>5x \, dx</m>. We need to use a completely different strategy to solve this integral. 
      </p>
      <p> 
      If we somehow knew that 
      <men xml:id="eqn-part-frac-1">
        \frac{5x}{x^2-x-2} = \frac{10/3}{x-2} + \frac{5/3}{x+1}
      </men>
      then we could integrate both sides of the equation to get 
      <me>
        \int \frac{5x}{x^2-x-2} \, dx = \int \frac{10/3}{x-2} + \frac{5/3}{x+1} \, dx
      </me>, and the integral on the right involves two nearly-basic antiderivatives, giving us
      <me>
        \int \frac{5x}{x^2-x-2} \, dx = \frac{10}{3} \ln|x-2| + \frac{5}{3}\ln|x+1| + C
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Setting aside the question of where the right-hand-side came from for a brief moment, 
      we can verify that <xref ref="eqn-part-frac-1"/> is indeed true by recombining the right-hand-side of the equation using a common denominator.  
      <md>
        <mrow> \frac{\frac{10}{3}}{x-2} + \frac{\frac{5}{3}}{x+1} \amp = \frac{\frac{10}{3}\cdot(x+1)}{(x-2)\cdot(x+1)} + \frac{\frac{5}{3}\cdot(x-2)}{(x+1)\cdot(x-2)}</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp =\frac{\frac{10}{3}x+\frac{10}{3}+\frac{5}{3}x-\frac{10}{3} }{(x-2)(x+1)}</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp =\frac{ \frac{15}{3}x}{(x-2)(x+1)}</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp =\frac{5x}{x^2-x-2}</mrow>
         
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      However, we do want to answer the big question: how did we come up with
      <me>
        \frac{5x}{x^2-x-2} = \frac{10/3}{x-2} + \frac{5/3}{x+1}
      </me>
      in the first place?  And how can we do the same thing to other integrals (reduce a function we can't integrate with the method of substitution
      to a sum of functions we can integrate more easily?)
    </p>

    <p>
        One clue is that the denominator of the rational function in the integral factors into two linear terms,
        <me>
          x^2-x-2 = (x-2)(x+1)
        </me>,
        and those are exactly the denominators of the simpler rational functions we used.  We will proceed by 
        assuming there is some expression that is equal to the rational function and then solve for what the exact expression is. 
    </p>

  <example xml:id="ex-pf-linearterms"><title>Two linear terms</title>
  <p>
    Show that 
    <me>
        \int \frac{5x}{x^2-x-2} \, dx = \frac{10}{3} \ln|x-2| + \frac{5}{3}\ln|x+1| + C
      </me>.
  </p>
    <p>
     <em>Answer:</em> We first factor the denominator <m>x^2-x-2 = (x-2)(x+1)</m> and then suppose that
          <men xml:id="eqn-part-fracs-ex-lin1">
            \frac{5x}{(x-2)(x+1)} = \frac{A}{x-2} + \frac{B}{x+1}
          </men>
      for some constants <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.  If this is true, the integral becomes much 
      easier to calculate, since we can integrate both sides of <xref ref="eqn-part-fracs-ex-lin1"/> to get
      <men xml:id="eqn-part-fracs-ex-lin1a">
        \int \frac{5x}{x^2-x-2} \, dx = A \ln|x-2| + B\ln|x+1| + C
      </men>.
      </p>

    <p>
          We now start the process of solving for the values of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.  Multiplying both sides of <xref ref="eqn-part-fracs-ex-lin1"/> by the integrand's denominator <m>(x-2)(x+1)</m>,
          we find that
          <me>
            \frac{5x\cancel{(x-2)(x+1)}}{\cancel{(x-2)(x+1)}}= \frac{A(x+1)\cancel{(x-2)}}{\cancel{x-2}} + \frac{B\cancel{(x+1)}(x-2)}{\cancel{x+1}}
          </me>
          which means
          <men xml:id="eqn-part-fracs-ex-lin2">
            5x = A(x+1) + B(x-2)
          </men>.
    </p>
    <p>
        From here, we show one possible method of solving for the values of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
          Because <xref ref="eqn-part-fracs-ex-lin2"/> is true for <em>every value</em> of <m>x</m>,
          we can use inspired choices of <em>specific</em> <m>x</m>-values to help us find <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
          Taking <m>x = -1</m>, we have
          <me>
            5(-1) = A(0) + B(-3)
          </me>,
          so <m>B = \frac{5}{3}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
          Now setting <m>x = 2</m>, it follows that
          <me>
            5(2) = A(3) + B(0)
          </me>,
          so <m>A = \frac{10}{3}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
          Thus, substituting the values of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> into <xref ref="eqn-part-fracs-ex-lin1a"/> we get
          <me>
            \int \frac{5x}{x^2-x-2} \, dx = \frac{10}{3}\ln|x-2| + \frac{5}{3}\ln|x+1|+C
          </me>.
    </p>
    </example>

    <title>Quadratic Terms in the Factored Form of the Denominator</title> -->
    <remark>
    <p>
      The form of the partial fraction decomposition depends on how the denominator factors.   
    </p>
    </remark>
    <p>
      When we had a numerator of <m>x^2+x+4</m>, there are <m>3</m> numbers: the coefficient
      of the <m>x^2</m> term, the coefficient of the <m>x</m> term, and the constant term.  Using
      <m>\frac{A}{x-1}+\frac{B}{x^2+1}</m> gave us <m>2</m> numbers to solve for, <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>,
      and in this case, it was impossible to find values of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> to make the equality hold.  However, we can
      modify the partial fraction form to introduce a third number.
    </p>
    <example><title>One quadratic and one linear term</title>
        <p>
          Evaluate
          <me>
            \int \frac{x^2+x+4}{(x^2+1)(x-1)} \, dx
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Answer:</em> 
          We suppose that
            <me>
            \frac{x^2+x+4}{(x^2+1)(x-1)} = \frac{A}{x-1} + \frac{Bx+D}{x^2+1}
            </me>
          and note that this gives us <m>3</m> constants to work with.<fn>We avoid using <m>C</m> as a coefficient because we
          don't want to get it confused with the <m>+C</m> at the end of an indefinite integral.</fn>  Before we look for the values
           of the constants <m>A</m>, <m>B</m> and <m>D</m>, we will first integrate, using three of the building blocks in
           <xref ref="assemblage-partial-fracs-building-blocks" text="title"/>.  
           <mdn>
            <mrow> \int \frac{x^2+x+4}{(x^2+1)(x-1)}\, dx \amp = \int \left( \frac{A}{x-1} + \frac{Bx+D}{x^2+1}\right)\, dx </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = \int \left(\frac{A}{x-1} + \frac{Bx}{x^2+1} + \frac{D}{x^2+1}\right)\, dx </mrow>
            <mrow xml:id="eqn-pfexample-antiderivs"> \amp = A\ln|x-1| + \frac{B}{2}\ln|x^2+1| + D\arctan(x) +C </mrow>
           </mdn>
        </p>
        <p>
          We have obtained a general antiderivative, as long as we can find such numbers <m>A</m>, <m>B</m> and <m>D</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that we've done the calculus part, we turn our attention to the algebra.  
          Multiplying both sides of the integrand by <m>(x-1)(x^2+1)</m>,
          we find that
          <me>
            \frac{(x^2+x+4)\cancel{(x-1)(x^2+1)}}{\cancel{(x-1)(x^2+1)}}= \frac{A(x^2+1)\cancel{(x-1)}}{\cancel{x-1}} + \frac{(Bx+D)\cancel{(x^2+1)}(x-1)}{\cancel{x^2+1}}
          </me>
          which means
          <men xml:id="eqn-pf-ex2-coeffs1">
            x^2+x+4 = A(x^2+1) + (Bx+D)(x-1)
          </men>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have several ways of solving for values of <m>A, B</m> and <m>D</m> which make 
          <xref ref="eqn-pf-ex2-coeffs1"/> true for all values of <m>x</m>.
          We could... 
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                ... use the black box method.  Use a solver like Wolfram Alpha or another computational tool.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                ... set <m>x</m> equal to different numerical values, as we did in <xref ref="ex-pf-linearterms"/>.
                We could set <m>x=1</m>, then <m>x=0</m>, and then <m>x=-1</m>, or choose any three
                values of <m>x</m> that we find easiest to work with.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                ... compare coefficients of both sides of the equation and get a system of equations to solve.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          We choose to 
          demonstrate the last method here.  Multiplying out the right-hand side of <xref ref="eqn-pf-ex2-coeffs1"/> and grouping
          like terms together gives
          <md>
            <mrow> x^2+x+4 \amp = A(x^2+1) + (Bx+D)(x-1) </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = Ax^2+A + Bx^2-Bx+Dx-D</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = (A+B)x^2+(-B+D)x+(A-D)</mrow>
          </md>
          Since the two sides must be equal as polynomials, equal for all values of <m>x</m>, this means 
          that the corresponding coefficients must be equal.  
          <md>
            <mrow> x^2 \text{ terms} \amp : 1=A+B  \amp \text{ because } x^2=(A+B)x^2 </mrow>
            <mrow> x \text{ terms} \amp : 1=-B+D \amp \text{ because } x = (-B+D)x </mrow>
            <mrow> \text{ constant terms} \amp : 4 = A-D \amp </mrow>
          </md>
          We now have a system of linear equations to solve, with three equations and three unknowns, which
          we can solve using any of the usual tools at our disposal.  The fastest way of solving for <m>A, B</m> and 
          <m>D</m> by hand is combining this linear system with the method of choosing strategic values of <m>x</m>.
           <!-- Setting like coefficients equal means that <m>A+B=1</m> (because those are the corresponding
          coefficients of the <m>x^2</m> term) and <m>-B+D=1</m> (because those are the corresponding
          coefficients of the <m>x</m> term) and <m>A-D=4</m> (because those are the constant terms). -->
        </p>
        <p>
            Setting <m>x=1</m> in <xref ref="eqn-pf-ex2-coeffs1"/> yields 
            <md>
              <mrow> 1^2+1+4 \amp =A(1^2+1)+(B\cdot 1 +D)(1-1)</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = 2A+0</mrow>
            </md>,
            and thus <m>6=2A</m>, so <me>A=3</me>. 
            Now the system of equations with three unknowns is reduced to having only two unknowns. 
          </p>
          <p> 
            Also, since <m>A=3</m>, and comparing coefficients of the <m>x^2</m> terms gave us that <m>A+B=1</m>,
            this means that <m>3+B=1</m>, so <me>B=-2</me>.  
            Similarly, since comparing the constant terms gave us that <m>A-D=4</m> and we know that <m>A=3</m>, this means that 
            <me>D=-1</me>.
          </p>
          <p>
            We had already integrated in <xref ref="eqn-pfexample-antiderivs"/>, and so substituting 
          the values we've just found for <m>A, B</m> and <m>D</m> gives us our final answer of
          <md>
            <mrow>\int \frac{x^2+x+4}{(x^2+1)(x-1)} \, dx \amp = 3\ln|x-1|+\frac{-2}{2}\ln|x^2+1|-1\arctan(x) +C</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = 3\ln|x-1|-\ln|x^2+1|-\arctan(x) +C</mrow>.
          </md>
        </p>
      </example>
        <p>
          It's worth noting that if we've had a little bit of matrix theory or linear algebra, we can use matrices to solve a system of linear equations, and that would give us
          <md>
            <mrow>\amp A \amp \amp+ B \amp \amp \ \amp \amp=1 </mrow>
            <mrow>\amp  \amp \amp- B \amp \amp+ D \amp \amp=1 </mrow>
            <mrow>\amp A \amp \amp \amp \amp-D \amp \amp=4 </mrow>
          </md>
          which becomes <m>\begin{bmatrix} 1 \amp 1 \amp 0 \amp 1 \\ 0 \amp -1 \amp 1 \amp 1 \\1 \amp 0 \amp -1 \amp 4 \end{bmatrix}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Solving this using Gaussian elimination results in <m>\begin{bmatrix} 1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 3 \\ 0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \amp -2 \\0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp -1 \end{bmatrix}</m>,
          which does give us the same values of <m>A=3</m>, <m>B=-2</m>, and <m>D=-1</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, this matrix form tells us something more:
          that this system of equations will have a unique solution <alert>regardless of the starting coefficients of the quadratic in the numerator of the integrand.</alert>
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that we don't have to use matrices at all - we have other tools for solving a system of equations. However, this example generalizes and bears repeating: 
           <alert>as long as the numerator of the integrand is less than or equal to degree <m>2</m>, and the denominator factors into a linear and an irreducible quadratic,
          we can find a partial fraction decomposition and calculate the integral by setting it up in this way, with a constant over the linear factor
          and a linear term over the quadratic factor.</alert><fn>See later for what to do if the degree is greater than or equal to <m>3</m> with this same factored form of the denominator.</fn>
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, we can see the problem that occurred when we had the wrong form of the partial fraction
          decomposition.  When we attempted to set <m>\frac{x^2+x+4}{(x^2+1)(x-1)} = \frac{A}{x-1}+\frac{B}{x^2+1}</m> and
          cleared the denominators, we got <me>x^2+x+4 = A(x^2+1)+B(x-1) = Ax^2+Bx+A-B.</me>
          Setting corresponding coefficients equal gives us
          <md>
            <mrow>\amp A \amp \amp \amp \amp=1 </mrow>
            <mrow>\amp  \amp \amp B \amp  \amp=1 </mrow>
            <mrow>\amp A \amp \amp-B \amp \amp=4 </mrow>
          </md>
          which becomes <m>\begin{bmatrix} 1 \amp 0  \amp 1 \\ 0 \amp 1  \amp 1 \\1 \amp -1  \amp 4 \end{bmatrix}</m>,
          which row reduces to <m>\begin{bmatrix} 1 \amp 0  \amp 1 \\ 0 \amp 1  \amp 1 \\0 \amp 0  \amp 1 \end{bmatrix}</m>, 
          an inconsistent system (no possible solutions for <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.)  
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the important takeaways from this is that the form of the partial fraction decomposition matters.

    <title>When The Degree of the Numerator is Greater Than Or Equal to the Degree of the Denominator</title>
    <p>
      We noted above that these partial fraction decomposition forms have enough constants to solve for every possible numerator only when
      the degree of the numerator is strictly less than the degree of the denominator.  What if the degree of the numerator is too large?
    </p>
    <p>
      In that case, we use polynomial division to rewrite the original integrand as the sum of a polynomial and a fraction whose numerator does
      have smaller degree than the denominator.  This is not unlike rewriting <m>\frac{15}{4}</m> (where the numerator is bigger than the denominator) as <m> 3+\frac{3}{4} </m> (where not the numerator is smaller than the denominator.)
      The hard part is figuring out how many times the denominator goes into the numerator evenly.

    <title>Final Considerations</title>
    
    <p>
      An especially astute reader might notice that we said that the denominator can contain terms of the form
      <m>ax^2+bx+c</m> but we only considered terms of the form <m>x^2+k</m> in our examples and activities.
      The reason is that every <m>ax^2+bx+c</m> can be written as <m>a\left( \left(x-\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2+k\right)</m>
      if we recall how to <em>complete the square</em> from algebra class, and then using a substitution<fn><m>y=x-\frac{b}{2a}</m>
      so that <m>dy=dx</m></fn> turns this into some constant number multiplied by <m>y^2+k</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this turns a calculus problem into even more of an algebra problem, and the focus of this material 
      is integration, not algebra.
    </p>
    <p>
      You might also be wondering what happens if the denominator doesn't factor into powers of linear and quadratic terms.
      It is a theorem beyond the scope of this class that every polynomial whose coefficients are real numbers factors into
      powers of linear and quadratic terms. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The result is that every rational function, regardless of the degree of the numerator or denominator,
      or how the denominator factors, can be integrated using some combination of the techniques
      described in this section.  Putting that theory into practice, however, is often quite difficult!

            Given any rational function with the degree of the numerator strictly less than the degree 
            of the denominator, we can rewrite the function as a sum of terms of the form
              <me>
                \frac{A}{(ax+b)^n}\ \text{or }\frac{Ax+B}{\left(ax^2 + bx +c \right)^n}
              </me>
            where <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>,
            and <m>c</m> are real numbers,
            and <m>n</m> is a natural number.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Which of the forms are included in the decomposition of a rational function depends entirely on the factored form of the denominator,
            and each of those forms can be integrated using basic integrals, substitution, and/or trigonometric substitution, possibly requiring some algebra.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Similar to how every improper fraction can be expressed as an integer plus a proper fraction, every rational function with the degree of the numerator greater than or equal to the degree 
            of the denominator can be expressed as <m>p(x)+\frac{q(x)}{r(x)}</m> where <m>p(x)</m> is a polynomial
            and the degree of <m>q(x)</m> is strictly less than the degree of <m>r(x)</m>.
