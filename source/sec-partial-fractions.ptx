  <introduction>
    <p>
      The need to integrate rational functions arises in differential equations and in other settings,
      and so we wonder about how to integrate them.  If we are lucky, we can use substitution or integration by parts, 
      but sometimes neither of those methods can be used.  
    </p>

    <example><title>Integrating A Rational Function with Substitution</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Evaluate
          <me>
            \int \frac{5x}{x^2-1} \, dx
          </me>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Placeholder for solution.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      In this case, the derivative of the function in the denominator was sitting in the numerator 
      (up to a constant multiple).  What if we needed to integrate this instead?
      <me>
        \int \frac{5x}{x^2-x-2} \, dx
      </me>?
    </p>
    <p>
      If we try to pick <m>u=x^2-x-2</m>, then we calculate that <m>du=(2x-1)\, dx</m>, which does not help
      us in the numerator.  
    </p>
    <p>
      So we try a different strategy.  If we somehow knew that 
      <me>
        \frac{5x}{x^2-x-2} = \frac{10/3}{x-2} + \frac{5/3}{x+1}
      </me>, 
      then we could integrate both sides of the equation to get 
      <me>
        \int \frac{5x}{x^2-x-2} \, dx = \int \frac{10/3}{x-2} + \frac{5/3}{x+1} \, dx
      </me>, and the integral on the right is straightforward, giving us
      <me>
        \int \frac{5x}{x^2-x-2} \, dx = \frac{10}{3} \ln|x-2| + \frac{5}{3}\ln|x+1| + C
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can verify that 
      <me>
        \frac{5x}{x^2-x-2} = \frac{10/3}{x-2} + \frac{5/3}{x+1}
      </me>
      is indeed true by recombining the right-hand-side of the equation using a common denominator.  
      <md>
        <mrow> \frac{10/3}{x-2} + \frac{5/3}{x+1} \amp = \frac{10/3(x+1)}{(x-2)(x+1)} + \frac{5/3(x-2)}{(x+1)(x-2)}</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp =\frac{\frac{10}{3}x+\frac{10}{3}+\frac{5}{3}x-\frac{10}{3} }{(x-2)(x+1)}</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp =\frac{ \frac{15}{3}x}{(x-2)(x+1)}</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp =\frac{5x}{x^2-x-2}</mrow>
         
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      But how did we come up with
      <me>
        \frac{5x}{x^2-x-2} = \frac{10/3}{x-2} + \frac{5/3}{x+1}
      </me>
      in the first place?
    </p>

    <p>
        One clue is that the denominator of the rational function in the integral factors into two linear terms,
        <me>
          x^2-x-2 = (x-2)(x+1)
        </me>,
        and those are exactly the denominators of the simpler rational functions we used.   
    </p>

    <p>
      We suppose that
          <me>
            \frac{5x}{(x-2)(x+1)} = \frac{A}{x-2} + \frac{B}{x+1}
          </me>
      and then we can look for the constants <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
          Multiplying both sides of this equation by <m>(x-2)(x+1)</m>,
          we find that
          <me>
            \frac{5x\cancel{(x-2)(x+1)}}{\cancel{(x-2)(x+1)}}= \frac{A(x+1)\cancel{(x-2)}}{\cancel{x-2}} + \frac{B\cancel{(x+1)}(x-2)}{\cancel{x+1}}
          </me>
          

          which means
          <me>
            5x = A(x+1) + B(x-2)
          </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
          Since we want this equation to hold for <em>every value</em> of <m>x</m>,
          we can use inspired choices of <em>specific</em> <m>x</m>-values to help us find <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.
          Taking <m>x = -1</m>, we have
          <me>
            5(-1) = A(0) + B(-3)
          </me>,
          so <m>B = \frac{5}{3}</m>.
          Choosing <m>x = 2</m>, it follows
          <me>
            5(2) = A(3) + B(0)
          </me>,
          so <m>A = \frac{10}{3}</m>.
          Thus,
          <me>
            \int \frac{5x}{x^2-x-2} \, dx = \int \frac{10/3}{x-2} + \frac{5/3}{x+1} \, dx
          </me>.
    </p>
  </introduction>

  <subsection>
    <title>Distinct Linear Terms (Or Factor the Denominator), or when can this be used?</title>
    <p>
      Notice that any terms of the form <m>\frac{A}{ax+b}</m>, a number in the numerator divided by a linear term
      in the denominator would be similarly easy to integrate.  
      <me>
        \int \frac{A}{ax+b} \, dx = \frac{A}{a}\ln|ax+b|+C
      </me>
      So the question is, when can we rewrite a rational function into terms like this?

      <!-- A similar method can be used whenever the denominator factors into distinct linear terms, as long
      as the numerator meets some conditions.   -->
    </p>

    <p>
      Do activity now?  Explore how to combine various partial fraction decompositions and have them make 
      conclusions or guesses about what the conditions are? Do linear ones, ones with numerator also a quadratic.
      Do any quadratic ones? Or repeated linear terms? Have them try a constant over a quadratic that doesn't work.

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-part-frac-3">
    <title>Final Considerations</title>
    
    <p>
      An astute reader might notice that we said that the denominator can contain terms of the form
      <m>ax^2+bx+c</m> but we only considered terms of the form <m>x^2+k</m> in our examples and activities.
      The reason is that every <m>ax^2+bx+c</m> can be written as <m>a\left( \left(x-\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2+k\right)</m>
      if we recall how to <em>complete the square</em> from algebra class, and then using a substitution <fn><m>y=x-\frac{b}{2a}</m>
      so that <m>dy=dx</m></fn> turns this into some constant number multiplied by <m>y^2+k</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this turns a calculus problem into even more of an algebra problem, and the focus of this material 
      is integration, not algebra.
    </p>
    <p>
      You might also be wondering what happens if the denominator doesn't factor into powers of linear and quadratic terms.
      It is a theorem beyond the scope of this class, called the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, that every polynomial over the real numbers factors into
      powers of linear and quadratic terms. 
      <!-- Is it really the FTA or is there another theorem for the real case? -->
    </p>

    <p>
      The result is that every rational function, regardless of the degree of the numerator or denominator,
      or how the denominator factors, can be integrated using some combination of the techniques
      described in this section.  Putting that theory into practice, however, is very often no trivial matter!

    <title>Summary</title>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Given any rational function with the degree of the numerator strictly less than the degree 
            of the denominator, we can rewrite the function as a sum of terms of the form
              <me>
                \frac{A}{ax+b},\ \frac{A}{(ax+b)^n},\ \frac{Ax+B}{ax^2 + bx+c},\ \text{or }\frac{Ax+B}{\left(ax^2 + bx +c \right)^n}
              </me>
            where <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>,
            and <m>c</m> are real numbers,
            and <m>k</m> is a positive real number.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Which of the forms are included in the decomposition of a rational function depends entirely on the factored form of the denominator,
            and each of those forms can be integrated using basic integrals, substitution, and/or trigonometric substitution, possibly requiring some algebra.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Similar to how every improper fraction can be expressed as an integer plus a proper fraction, every rational function with the degree of the numerator greater than or equal to the degree 
            of the denominator can be expressed as <m>p(x)+\frac{q(x)}{r(x)}</m> where <m>p(x)</m> is a polynomial
            and the degree of <m>q(x)</m> is strictly less than the degree of <m>r(x)</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            This means that every rational function has an antiderivative function we can express without an integral.
          </p>
