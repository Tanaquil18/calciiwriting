  <introduction>
    <p>
      The need to integrate rational functions arises in differential equations and in other settings,
      and so we wonder about how to integrate them.  If we are lucky, we can use substitution or integration by parts, 
      but sometimes neither of those methods can be used.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Evaluate
          <me>
            \int \frac{5x}{x^2-1} \, dx
          </me>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>

          Placeholder for solution. 

          If we factor the denominator,
          we can see how <m>R</m> might be the sum of two fractions of the form <m>\frac{A}{x-2} + \frac{B}{x+1}</m>, so we
          suppose that
          <me>
            \frac{5x}{(x-2)(x+1)} = \frac{A}{x-2} + \frac{B}{x+1}
          </me>
          and look for the constants <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Multiplying both sides of this equation by <m>(x-2)(x+1)</m>,
          we find that
          <me>
            5x = A(x+1) + B(x-2)
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since we want this equation to hold for every value of <m>x</m>,
          we can use insightful choices of specific <m>x</m>-values to help us find <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.
          Taking <m>x = -1</m>, we have
          <me>
            5(-1) = A(0) + B(-3)
          </me>,
          so <m>B = \frac{5}{3}</m>.
          Choosing <m>x = 2</m>, it follows
          <me>
            5(2) = A(3) + B(0)
          </me>,
          so <m>A = \frac{10}{3}</m>.
          Thus,
          <me>
            \int \frac{5x}{x^2-x-2} \, dx = \int \frac{10/3}{x-2} + \frac{5/3}{x+1} \, dx
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p>
          This integral is straightforward to evaluate,
          and hence we find that
          <me>
            \int \frac{5x}{x^2-x-2} \, dx = \frac{10}{3} \ln|x-2| + \frac{5}{3}\ln|x+1| + C
          </me>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      In this case, the derivative of the function in the denominator was sitting in the numerator 
      (up to a constant multiple).  What if we needed to integrate this instead?
      <me>
        \int \frac{5x}{x^2-x-2} \, dx
      </me>?
    </p>
    <p>
      If we try to pick <m>u=x^2-x-2</m>, then we calculate that <m>du=(2x-1)\, dx</m>, which does not help
      us in the numerator.  
    </p>
    <p>
      So we try a different strategy.  If we somehow knew that 
      <me>
        \frac{5x}{x^2-x-2} = \frac{10/3}{x-2} + \frac{5/3}{x+1}
      </me>, 
      then we could integrate both sides of the equation to get 
      <me>
        \int \frac{5x}{x^2-x-2} \, dx = \int \frac{10/3}{x-2} + \frac{5/3}{x+1} \, dx
      </me>, and the integral on the right is straightforward, giving us
      <me>
        \int \frac{5x}{x^2-x-2} \, dx = \frac{10}{3} \ln|x-2| + \frac{5}{3}\ln|x+1| + C
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can verify that 
      <me>
        \frac{5x}{x^2-x-2} = \frac{10/3}{x-2} + \frac{5/3}{x+1}
      </me>
      by recombining the right-hand-side of the equation using a common denominator.  
      <md>
        <mrow> \frac{10/3}{x-2} + \frac{5/3}{x+1} \amp = \frac{10/3(x+1)}{(x-2)(x+1)} + \frac{5/3(x-2)}{(x+1)(x-2)}</mrow>
         
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      But how did we know that 
      <me>
        \frac{5x}{x^2-x-2} = \frac{10/3}{x-2} + \frac{5/3}{x+1}
      </me>? 
      And that the second form would be easier to integrate than the first form?
    </p>

    <p>
        One clue is that the denominator of the rational function in the integral factors into two linear terms,
        <me>
          x^2-x-2 = (x-2)(x+1)
        </me>,
        and those are exactly the denominators of the simpler rational functions we used.

    <p permid="Pnt">
      Any moving object has a <em>position</em>
          <idx><h>position</h></idx>
      that can be considered a function of <em>time</em>.
      When the motion is along a straight line,
      the position is given by a single variable,
      which we denote by <m>s(t)</m>.
      For example,
      <m>s(t)</m> might give the mile marker of a car traveling on a straight highway at time <m>t</m> in hours.
      Similarly, the function <m>s</m> described in <xref ref="PA-1-1">Preview Activity</xref> is a position function,
      where position is measured vertically relative to the ground.
    </p>

    <p permid="vuC">
      On any time interval, a moving object also has an
      <em>average velocity</em>.
      For example,
      to compute a car's average velocity we divide the number of miles traveled by the time elapsed,
      which gives the velocity in <em>miles per hour</em>.
      Similarly, the value of <m>AV_{[0.5,1]}</m> in <xref ref="PA-1-1">Preview Activity</xref>
      gave the average velocity of the ball on the time interval <m>[0.5,1]</m>,

    <title>Instantaneous Velocity</title>
    <p permid="TXm">
      Whether we are driving a car,
      riding a bike, or throwing a ball,
      we have an intuitive sense that a moving object has a velocity at any given moment -- a number that measures how fast the object is moving <em>right now</em>.
      For instance,
      a car's speedometer tells the driver the car's velocity at any given instant.
      In fact, the velocity on a speedometer is really an average velocity that is computed over a very small time interval.
      If we let the time interval over which average velocity is computed become shorter and shorter,
      we can progress from average velocity to
      <em>instantaneous</em> velocity.
    </p>

    <p permid="Aev">
      Informally, we define the <em>instantaneous velocity</em>
          <idx><h>instantaneous velocity</h></idx>
      of a moving object at time <m>t = a</m> to be the value that the average velocity approaches as we take smaller and smaller intervals of time containing <m>t = a</m>.
      We will develop a more formal definition of instantaneous velocity soon,
      and this definition will be the foundation of much of our work in calculus.
      For now, it is fine to think of instantaneous velocity as follows:
      take average velocities on smaller and smaller time intervals around a specific point.
      If those average velocities approach a single number,
      then that number will be the instantaneous velocity at that point.

      <!-- As we saw in in <xref ref="act-1-1-1">Activity</xref>,
      it follows that ...
      (will cross-referencing work for activities?)
      -->
      At this point we have started to see a close connection between average velocity and instantaneous velocity.
      Each is connected not only to the physical behavior of the moving object but also to the geometric behavior of the graph of the position function.
      We are interested in computing average velocities on the interval <m>[a,b]</m> for smaller and smaller intervals.
      In order to make the link between average and instantaneous velocity more formal,
      think of the value <m>b</m> as <m>b = a + h</m>,
      where <m>h</m> is a small (non-zero) number that is allowed to vary.
      Then the average velocity of the object on the interval <m>[a,a+h]</m> is
      <me permid="EOo">
        AV_{[a,a+h]} = \frac{s(a+h)-s(a)}{h}
      </me>,
      with the denominator being simply <m>h</m> because <m>(a+h) - a = h</m>.
      Note that when <m>h \lt  0</m>,
      <m>AV_{[a,a+h]}</m> measures the average velocity on the interval <m>[a+h,a]</m>.

    <p permid="MsN">
      To find the instantaneous velocity at <m>t = a</m>,
      we investigate what happens as the value of <m>h</m> approaches zero.

              as this is the duration of time during which the ball is falling.
              We want to compute and simplify

              We start by finding <m>s(0.5+h)</m>.
              To do so, we follow the rule that defines the function <m>s</m>.
              <md permid="dqY">

              </md>.
              Now, returning to our computation of the average velocity,
              we find that
              <md permid="Jyh">
                <mrow>AV_{[0.5, 0.5+h]} \amp  =  \frac{s(0.5+h) - s(0.5)}{(0.5+h) - 0.5}</mrow>

              </md>.
              At this point, we note two things:
              first, the expression for average velocity clearly depends on <m>h</m>,
              which it must,
              since as <m>h</m> changes the average velocity will change.
              Further, we note that since <m>h</m> can never equal zero,
              we may remove the common factor of <m>h</m> from the numerator and denominator.
              It follows that
              <me permid="RcG">
                AV_{[0.5, 0.5+h]} = -16 - 16h
              </me>.
            </li>

            <li permid="tFp">
              From this expression we can compute the average for any small positive or negative value of <m>h</m>.
              For instance, to obtain the average velocity on
              <m>[0.5,0.75]</m>, we let <m>h = 0.25</m>,
              and the average velocity is <m>-16 - 16(0.25) = -20</m> ft/sec.
              To get the average velocity on <m>[0.4, 0.5]</m>,
              we let <m>h = -0.1</m>, and compute the average velocity as
              <me permid="xjP">
                -16 - 16(-0.1) = -14.4\ \text{ft/sec}

            </li>

            <li permid="ZMy">
              We can even explore what happens to
              <m>AV_{[0.5, 0.5+h]}</m> as <m>h</m> gets closer and closer to zero.
              As <m>h</m> approaches zero,
              <m>-16h</m> will also approach zero,
              so it appears that the instantaneous velocity of the ball at <m>t = 0.5</m> should be <m>-16</m> ft/sec.

          the average velocity of the object on the time interval <m>[a,b]</m> is given by <m>AV_{[a,b]} = \frac{s(b) - s(a)}{b-a}</m>.
          Viewing the interval <m>[a,b]</m> as having the form <m>[a,a+h]</m>,
          we equivalently compute average velocity by the formula <m>AV_{[a,a+h]} = \frac{s(a+h) - s(a)}{h}</m>.
        </li>

        <li permid="oVw">
          The instantaneous velocity of a moving object at a fixed time is estimated by considering average velocities on shorter and shorter time intervals that contain the instant of interest.
