ERROR   : * PTX:ERROR:   a cross-reference ("xref") uses references [int-with-sub-ex] that do not point to any target, or perhaps point to multiple targets.  Maybe you typed an @xml:id value wrong, maybe the target of the @xml:id is nonexistent, or maybe you temporarily removed the target from your source, or maybe an auxiliary file contains a duplicate.
